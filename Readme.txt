This is the basic set up of my GAS system using PlayerState. I have kept this super minimal so it is easy to understand / expand.

What is has:

- Ability system component in PlayerState
- Health attribute
- Ability bindings for 2 abilities
- Helper functions for use in BP

How to use:

Create / reparent your CharacterBP form "CharacterBase"
Create / reparent your PlayerStateBP from "PlayerstateBase"

Add abilities to your Character in the PlayerStateBP you created under Ability 1, Ability 2.

Message me on Discord Narxim#7457 if you have any questions.
