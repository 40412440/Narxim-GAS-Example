Updated by Narxim 2/9/21, made with UE4 version 4.26.1

Version 2.0! This updated version represents the knowldge I have acquired over the past couple of years using GAS.

This is a basic set-up for GAS using PlayerState. I have kept the code minimal so it is easy to understand / expand.

What is has:

- Ability System Component in PlayerState
- Health Attribute Set (With Damage / Healing)
- Stamina Attribute Set
- Ability bindings
- GA Jump example with stamina cost
- Generic NPC GA use example (Jump)
- Stamina regen example (Based on Stamina Regeneration Attribute)
- Helper functions for use in BP
- Give Gameplay Ability function in BP
- Commented code

This version is a complete starter project!
